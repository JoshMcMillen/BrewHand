```javascript
/**
 * Performs arithmetic addition with comprehensive error handling
 * @param {number} a - First operand
 * @param {number} b - Second operand
 * @returns {number} Sum of a and b
 * @throws {TypeError} When operands are not numbers
 * @throws {RangeError} When operands are not finite
 */
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
    throw new TypeError('Both operands must be numbers');
  }
  
  if (!Number.isFinite(a) || !Number.isFinite(b)) {
    throw new RangeError('Operands must be finite numbers');
  }
  
  return a + b;

- Check if you're working with supported file types
- Restart VS Code and check the Output panel for errors

**Chat participant (@brewhand) not appearing**
- Restart VS Code
- Verify the extension is enabled in Extensions view
- Check that your AI language model extension is active

**Shell command validation not working**
- Verify `brewhand.shellDetection` is set to "auto"
- Check if `brewhand.autoFixShellSyntax` is enabled
- Ensure you're using supported shell environments

**Budget tracking showing incorrect data**
- Verify your AI language model subscription is active
- Check BrewHand settings for correct budget configuration
- Use "BrewHand: Reset Monthly Usage" if data is corrupted

**Status bar not showing**
- Enable `brewhand.showUsageInStatusBar` in settings
- Restart VS Code if the status bar item doesn't appear
- Check for conflicting extensions that might hide status bar items

### **Performance Issues**

**Slow response times**
