## 🛠️ New Configuration Options

Add these to your VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "brewhand.enableIterativeSupport": true,
  "brewhand.continuousAssistanceMode": false,
  "brewhand.showIterativeSuggestions": true
}
```

## 🔍 Example Workflow

### Before (Standard Copilot)
1. Ask Copilot to create a function
2. Copilot reads files, writes code
3. You ask for modifications
4. Copilot starts from scratch, re-reads everything
5. No context maintained between requests

### After (Enhanced BrewHand)
1. `@brewhand create a user authentication system`
2. BrewHand maintains context and shell awareness
3. `@brewhand add error handling to the auth system`
4. BrewHand remembers the previous auth system context
5. Provides targeted improvements without re-reading everything
6. Suggests next steps based on workflow patterns

## 🎮 New Commands Available

Access these via Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`):

- **BrewHand: Toggle Iterative Support** - Enable/disable iterative features
- **BrewHand: Continue Workflow** - Resume an active workflow session
- **BrewHand: Pause Workflow** - Temporarily pause continuous assistance
- **BrewHand: Show Workflow Summary** - View current session details
- **BrewHand: Clear Workflow History** - Reset all conversation contexts

## 🚦 Status Bar Indicators

Watch for these status bar indicators:

## 🧪 Testing the Enhancement

To test if the enhancement is working:

1. **Start an iterative task**:

   ```

2. **Follow up with related requests**:
   ```
   @brewhand add authentication middleware
   @brewhand add error handling
   @brewhand add logging
   ```

3. **Watch for**:
   - Context maintained between requests
   - Workflow step indicators in responses
   - Suggestions for next steps
   - Continuous assistance prompts
