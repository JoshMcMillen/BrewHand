# BrewHand

A VS Code extension that enhances GitHub Copilot with a "do it right the first time" philosophy, eliminating the "make it work then make it better" cycle. Now with **intelligent budget management** and **complexity-aware model selection**.

## üéØ Philosophy

Instead of generating quick-and-dirty code that requires refactoring, this extension focuses on:

- **Production-ready code from the start**
- **Comprehensive error handling and input validation**
- **Proper architectural patterns and design principles**
- **Self-documenting, maintainable code**
- **Performance, security, and scalability considerations upfront**
- **No TODO comments or placeholder implementations**
- **Smart budget management** for premium model usage
- **Complexity-aware model selection** to optimize cost vs quality

## ‚ú® Features

### üéØ **Smart Budget Management**

Intelligent tracking and optimization of premium request usage:

- **Monthly Budget Tracking**: Local session tracking with configurable limits (default: 50 premium requests/month)
- **Budget Strategies**: Choose from Conservative (25%), Balanced (50%), or Aggressive (75%) usage patterns
- **Real-time Warnings**: Notifications at 75% and 90% budget usage
- **Cost-aware Model Selection**: Automatically selects optimal model based on remaining budget
- **Usage Dashboard**: Visual dashboard showing usage statistics and budget management tips

### üß† **Complexity Analysis**

Advanced task analysis to determine optimal model selection:

- **Keyword Detection**: Identifies complex patterns (architecture, performance, security, etc.)
- **Scope Analysis**: Evaluates multi-file vs single-file operations
- **Context Awareness**: Considers project type, language, and task requirements
- **Dynamic Model Selection**: Routes simple tasks to included models, complex tasks to premium models

### üìä **Usage Dashboard**

Visual interface for monitoring and managing your premium usage:

- **Usage Statistics**: Monthly progress bars and request counts
- **Budget Management**: Current strategy and remaining budget
- **Cost Breakdown**: Per-model usage tracking
- **Smart Tips**: Personalized recommendations for optimizing usage

### üíé **Enhanced Ruby Support**

Special focus on Ruby development with **Tier 2 - Good Support (80-85% quality)** using premium request models strategically:

**Smart Budget Management for Ruby:**
- **High-value tasks**: Uses Claude Opus 4 (~15 requests) for complex architecture
- **Standard tasks**: Uses Claude Sonnet 4 (~5 requests) for everyday Rails work  
- **Simple tasks**: Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet (included) to preserve premium budget
- **Budget-aware fallback**: Automatically optimizes quality vs cost

**Latest Model Benefits for Ruby:**
- **Claude Sonnet 4**: Significant upgrade for Ruby idioms and Rails patterns
- **Hybrid reasoning**: Better architectural decisions for complex Rails applications  
- **Enhanced metaprogramming**: Improved understanding of Ruby's dynamic features
- **Performance insights**: Better optimization recommendations

**Rails Ecosystem Mastery:**
- Automatic detection of Gemfile, Rails config, and gems with latest context understanding
- MVC patterns and RESTful conventions with improved architectural reasoning
- Background job patterns (Sidekiq, Resque) with better concurrency handling
- Authentication patterns (Devise, custom) with enhanced security recommendations

**Example Ruby Enhancement with Smart Model Selection:**
```ruby
# High-value architecture task ‚Üí Claude Opus 4 (15 premium requests)
@brewhand Create a comprehensive Rails service object architecture for payment processing

# Standard Rails task ‚Üí Claude Sonnet 4 (5 premium requests)  
@brewhand Generate a Rails controller with proper error handling and validation

# Simple task ‚Üí Claude 3.5 Sonnet (included, preserves premium budget)
@brewhand Add basic validation to this Rails model
```

**Quality vs Budget Optimization:**
- **Previous approach**: Always use highest-quality model regardless of cost
- **Smart approach**: Match model capability to task complexity and budget
- **Result**: More premium requests available for truly complex tasks
- **Outcome**: Better overall productivity within budget constraints

### üß† Intelligent Model Selection with Premium Request Management

The extension automatically selects the optimal LLM based on your task **and manages your premium request budget**. All users have access to the same models, but premium models consume premium requests from your monthly allowance:

**GitHub Copilot Plans:**
- **Copilot Free**: 50 premium requests/month
- **Copilot Pro**: $10/month, 300 premium requests/month + unlimited standard completions
- **Copilot Pro+**: $39/month, 1500 premium requests/month + unlimited standard completions  
- **Copilot Business**: $19/user/month, 300 premium requests/user/month
- **Copilot Enterprise**: $39/user/month, 1000 premium requests/user/month

**Premium Request Models (consume from monthly allowance):**
- **Claude Opus 4**: World's best coding model (~15-20 requests per query)
- **OpenAI o3**: Most capable reasoning (~20 requests per query)
- **GPT-4.5**: Improved reasoning (~12 requests per query)
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**: Hybrid reasoning (~8 requests per query)
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Advanced reasoning (~8 requests per query)
- **Claude Sonnet 4**: Excellent coding (~5 requests per query)
- **GPT-4.1**: Balanced performance (~3 requests per query)
- **o3-mini/o1-mini**: Efficient reasoning (~2-3 requests per query)
- **o4-mini**: Most efficient (~1 request per query)

**Standard Models (included in all plans):**
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Fast and efficient for everyday tasks
- **GPT-4o**: Multimodal general purpose with good reasoning
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro**: Multimodal understanding and large context

**Smart Budget Management:**
1. **Prioritizes model quality** for your specific task and language
2. **Considers request multipliers** to maximize your monthly allowance
3. **Falls back to standard models** when premium budget is low
4. **Shows request cost** for transparency (`üöÄ Using Claude Sonnet 4 (5 premium requests)`)
5. **Tracks usage** to help you manage your monthly allowance

**Example Budget-Aware Selection:**
```
Early in month + Complex Ruby task:
üöÄ Using Claude Opus 4 (15 premium requests) - World-class quality

Mid-month + Standard task:
üöÄ Using Claude Sonnet 4 (5 premium requests) - Excellent quality

Low budget + Simple task:
‚ú® Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet (included) - Good quality, no premium cost

Budget exhausted:
‚ú® Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet (included) - Standard model, saves premium requests
```

**Quality vs Cost Optimization:**
- **High-value tasks**: Uses premium models (architecture, complex debugging)
- **Standard tasks**: Balances quality and cost efficiently
- **Simple tasks**: Uses included models to preserve premium budget
- **Budget awareness**: Automatically adjusts strategy based on remaining allowance

    };
  }

  // Length validation (RFC 5321)
  if (email.length > maxLength) {
    errors.push(`Email exceeds maximum length of ${maxLength} characters`);
  }

  // Normalize email
  const normalizedEmail = email.trim().toLowerCase();

  // Basic format validation
  const emailRegex = allowInternational 
    ? /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/u
    : /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/;

  if (!emailRegex.test(normalizedEmail)) {
    errors.push('Invalid email format');
  }

  // Additional validations
  const [localPart, domain] = normalizedEmail.split('@');
  
  if (localPart && localPart.length > 64) {
    errors.push('Local part exceeds 64 characters');
  }

  if (domain && requireTLD && !domain.includes('.')) {
    errors.push('Email must include a top-level domain');
  }

  return {
    isValid: errors.length === 0,
    errors,
    normalizedEmail: errors.length === 0 ? normalizedEmail : undefined
  };
}
```

### Code Enhancement

**Before:**
```javascript
function fetchUser(id) {
  return fetch(`/api/users/${id}`).then(r => r.json());
}
```

**After Enhancement:**
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

interface FetchUserOptions {
  timeout?: number;
  retries?: number;
  signal?: AbortSignal;
}

class UserFetchError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public readonly statusCode?: number,
    public readonly userId?: string
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'UserFetchError';
  }
}

/**
 * Fetches user data with comprehensive error handling and retry logic
 * @param id - User ID to fetch
 * @param options - Fetch configuration options
 * @returns Promise resolving to user data
 * @throws UserFetchError for various failure scenarios
 */
export async function fetchUser(
  id: string,
  options: FetchUserOptions = {}
): Promise<User> {
  const { timeout = 5000, retries = 3, signal } = options;

  // Input validation
  if (!id || typeof id !== 'string') {
    throw new UserFetchError('User ID must be a non-empty string', undefined, id);
  }

  // Sanitize ID to prevent injection
  const sanitizedId = encodeURIComponent(id.trim());
  
  let lastError: Error;

  for (let attempt = 0; attempt <= retries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const controller = new AbortController();
      const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), timeout);
      
      // Combine signals if provided
      const combinedSignal = signal 
        ? AbortSignal.any([signal, controller.signal])
        : controller.signal;

      const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${sanitizedId}`, {
        signal: combinedSignal,
        headers: {
          'Accept': 'application/json',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
      });

      clearTimeout(timeoutId);

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new UserFetchError(
          `Failed to fetch user: ${response.statusText}`,
          response.status,
          id
        );
      }

      const userData = await response.json();
      
      // Validate response structure
      if (!userData || typeof userData !== 'object') {
        throw new UserFetchError('Invalid user data received', response.status, id);
      }

      return userData as User;

    } catch (error) {
      lastError = error instanceof Error ? error : new Error(String(error));
      
      // Don't retry on certain errors
      if (error instanceof UserFetchError && error.statusCode === 404) {
        throw error;
      }

      if (attempt === retries) {
        break;
      }

      // Exponential backoff
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000 * Math.pow(2, attempt)));
    }
  }

  throw new UserFetchError(
    `Failed to fetch user after ${retries + 1} attempts: ${lastError.message}`,
    undefined,
    id
  );
}
```

## üåç Language Support & Limitations

### **Language Support Tiers**

The extension works with any programming language, but quality varies significantly based on LLM training data availability:

- **Legacy languages** (COBOL, FORTRAN, etc.) - improved with reasoning models
- **Esoteric languages**
- **Company-specific languages**

### **Key Limitations**

#### **1. Training Data Bias**
> Most LLM benchmarks focus heavily on Python due to its prevalence in ML research

**Impact**: 
- Python code generation achieves 90%+ accuracy on benchmarks
- Less common languages may have 40-60% accuracy
- BrewHand prompts work best with Tier 1 languages

**Mitigation**:
```typescript
// Extension automatically adjusts expectations and prompts by language
const languageSupport = getLanguageSupport('haskell');
// Returns: "Tier 4 - Minimal (40-60% quality) - manual review required"
```

#### **2. Architecture Pattern Availability**
**Tier 1 Languages**: Rich modern patterns, comprehensive error handling, enterprise practices
**Tier 4 Languages**: Limited patterns, outdated practices, manual review needed

#### **3. Model-Specific Language Strengths**
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Best reasoning across languages, architectural thinking
- **GPT-4o**: Strong in popular languages, good code structure  
- **Gemini Pro**: Better multilingual understanding

#### **4. Technical Limitations**

**VS Code Language Model API**: 
- Requires active Copilot subscription
- Rate limiting applies to all models
- Model availability varies by organization settings

**Context Windows**:
- Large codebases may exceed context limits
- Extension automatically prioritizes relevant context

**Real-time Updates**:
- Training data has cutoff dates
- Newest language features may not be well-supported

### **Language-Specific Recommendations**

#### **For Tier 1 Languages (Python, JS/TS, Java, C#)**
```
@brewhand Create a rate-limited HTTP client with retry logic
```
**Expected**: Production-ready code with comprehensive error handling, proper typing, architectural explanations

#### **For Tier 3-4 Languages (Swift, Haskell, COBOL)**
```
@brewhand Create a basic file parser with error handling

Note: This is a Tier 3 language. Please review the following areas:
- Framework-specific patterns may need verification
- Error handling may need language-specific adjustments  
- Performance optimizations should be manually reviewed
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Extension not working?**
1. Ensure GitHub Copilot is installed and active
2. Check that you have at least one language model enabled
3. Verify VS Code version compatibility (1.93.0+)

**"No suitable language model available" message?**
1. Verify your GitHub Copilot subscription is active
2. Check if your organization has restricted certain models
3. Try logging out and back into GitHub Copilot
4. Restart VS Code and try again

**Getting standard models instead of premium models?**
1. Check your premium request allowance (Free: 50/month, Pro: 300/month, Pro+: 1500/month)
2. Premium models consume 1-20 requests per query depending on complexity
3. Extension automatically falls back to standard models when budget is low
4. Consider upgrading to Pro+ ($39/month) for 1500 premium requests

**Want to check your premium request usage?**
1. The extension shows request cost with each model: "Using Claude Opus 4 (15 premium requests)"
2. Check your GitHub Copilot dashboard for remaining allowance
3. Standard models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o) are unlimited and included in all plans

**Lower quality results than expected?**
1. Premium models provide significantly better results but consume premium requests
2. Standard models (included) still provide good quality (80-85%) for most tasks
3. Try enabling strict mode in settings for better prompts
4. Provide more detailed context in your prompts

**Model taking too long or rate limited?**
1. Check Copilot subscription status and usage limits
2. Premium models may have longer response times due to advanced reasoning
3. Try o4-mini or standard models for faster responses
4. Rate limits may apply during high usage periods
